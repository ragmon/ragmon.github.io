      h2 Introduction
      p Welcome to #[a(href="http://ragmon.nl/") Ragmon.nl]. I am a freelancer managing this site and am committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how I collect, use, and safeguard your data when you visit my website.

      h2 1. Personal Data Collection
      p I do not collect any personal information from users. The only data collected is through cookies used by Google Analytics to help me understand how visitors use the website.

      h2 2. Use of Cookies
      p Cookies are small text files placed on your device to improve your experience on the site. I use Google Analytics cookies to gather anonymous data about your browsing behavior to enhance the site's performance and user experience.

      h3 Types of Cookies I Use:
      ul
        li Google Analytics Cookies: These cookies collect information about how visitors use the site. The data is anonymous and helps me compile reports to improve the site's functionality and content.

      h3 Managing Cookies:
      p You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to decline them if you prefer. Additionally, you can delete cookies from your browser settings at any time. Please note that disabling cookies may affect the functionality of the website.

      h2 3. Data Processing
      p The data collected via Google Analytics cookies is solely for analyzing website traffic and user interactions to improve the services offered. No personal data is collected or processed.

      h2 4. Third-Party Sharing
      p I do not share your data with any third parties. The data collected through Google Analytics is managed by Google and used in accordance with their privacy policy.

      h2 5. Data Storage and Security
      p The data collected by Google Analytics is stored and managed by Google. I rely on Google's security measures to protect this data in compliance with GDPR. I do not store any additional data.

      h2 6. User Rights
      p Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right to:
      ul

        li Erase your data from our systems.
        li Restrict or object to how I process your data.
        li Port your data to another service provider.
      p Since only anonymous data is collected through Google Analytics, these rights generally do not apply. However, you can manage your cookie preferences through your browser settings as described above.
